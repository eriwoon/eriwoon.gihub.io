            <p>受到恶劣天气影响，意大利的“水城”威尼斯遭遇了五十年来的最大洪水，圣马可大教堂等著名景点被淹，游客和居民不得不涉水甚至“游泳”行进。威尼斯市长称，这都是气候变化惹的祸。</p>
            <p>威尼斯市长称，导致威尼斯多处被淹的严重洪灾是气候变化的直接结果。</p>
            <p>威尼斯市长路易吉·布鲁尼亚罗在推特上说，威尼斯涨潮水位达到五十多年来的最高值，将留下“永恒印记”。</p>
            <p>“现在政府必须听一听我们的声音，”他补充道，“这是气候变化造成的影响……代价将是惨重的。”</p>
            <p>潮汐监测中心的数据显示，威尼斯涨潮水位最高达到1.87米。自从1923年开始有官方记录以来，这么高的水位只在1966年发生过一次，达到1.94米。</p>
            <p>圣马可广场——威尼斯市地势最低的一处地点——是受灾最严重的地方之一。</p>
            <p>根据圣马可大教堂的记录，该教堂的长方形廊柱大厅1200年来第六次被淹。圣马可理事会成员皮耶尔保罗·坎波斯特里尼指出，其中有四次洪水发生在过去二十年间。</p>
            <p>basilica[bəˈzɪlɪkə]: n. （古罗马）长方形会堂；长方形基督教堂；长方形廊柱大厅</p>
            <p>市长说，这座著名的地标“损毁严重”。地下室完全被淹没了，人们担心洪水对廊柱大厅的柱子造成结构性损坏。</p>
            <p>威尼斯市位于意大利东北海岸附近的一个环礁湖内，由100多座岛屿组成。</p>
            <p>洪水导致佩莱斯特里纳岛上的两个人丧生，这块狭长的岛屿将环礁湖与亚得里亚海分隔开来。其中一个人是在家中试图启动水泵时触电身亡。</p>
            <p>布鲁尼亚罗说，洪水带来的损失“极大”，他将宣布威尼斯进入灾难状态。他警告说，帮助阻止洪水在威尼斯环礁湖肆虐的工程“必须快点完成”。</p>
            <p>布鲁尼亚罗在推特上说：“情况很危急，我们请求政府的援助。”他补充道，学校要继续停课，直到洪水退去。</p>
            <p>他还敦促当地企业分享洪灾的照片和视频，以便在请求政府财政支援时能派上用场。</p>
            <p>威尼斯的许多企业都受到了影响。咖啡馆和餐厅外面漂浮着椅子和桌子。</p>
            <p>在商店里，店员试图将存货搬离被水淹没的地方，防止进一步损失。</p>
            <p>一位不具名的店主告诉意大利广播电视公司说：“整个城市都崩溃了。”</p>
            <p>三辆水上巴士沉没了，但游客们尽其所能继续自己的观光之旅。</p>
            <p>一对法国夫妇告诉法新社说，在威尼斯各处的一些木制浮桥被洪水冲翻后，他们“真的是游着在行进”。</p>

            <p>Severe flooding in Venice that has left much of the Italian city under water is a direct result of climate change, the mayor says.</p>
            <p>The highest water levels in the region in more than 50 years would leave "a permanent mark", Venice Mayor Luigi Brugnaro tweeted.</p>
            <p>"Now the government must listen," he added. "These are the effects of climate change... the costs will be high."</p>

            <p>Venice floods: Climate change behind highest tide in 50 years, says mayor</p>
            <p>The waters in Venice peaked at 1.87m, according to the tide monitoring centre. Only once since official records began in 1923 has the tide been higher, reaching 1.94m in 1966.</p>
            <p>St Mark's Square - one of the lowest parts of the city - was one of the worst hit areas.</p>
            <p>St Mark's Basilica was flooded for the sixth time in 1,200 years, according to church records. Pierpaolo Campostrini, a member of St Mark's council, said four of those floods had now occurred within the past 20 years.</p>
            <p>The mayor said the famous landmark had suffered "grave damage". The crypt was completely flooded and there are fears of structural damage to the basilica's columns.</p>

            <p>The city of Venice is made up of more than 100 islands inside a lagoon off the north-east coast of Italy.</p>
            <p>Two people died on the island of Pellestrina, a thin strip of land that separates the lagoon from the Adriatic Sea. One of them was electrocuted as he tried to start a pump in his home.</p>
            <p>Mr Brugnaro said the damage was "huge" and that he would declare a state of disaster, warning that a project to help prevent the Venetian lagoon suffering devastating floods "must be finished soon".</p>
            <p>"The situation is dramatic. We ask the government to help us," he said on Twitter, adding that schools would remain closed until the water level subsides.</p>
            <p>He also urged local businesses to share photos and video footage of the devastation, which he said would be useful when requesting financial help from the government.</p>

            <p>A number of businesses were affected. Chairs and tables were seen floating outside cafes and restaurants.</p>
            <p>In shops, workers tried to move their stock away from the water to prevent any further damage.</p>
            <p>One shopkeeper, who was not named, told Italy's public broadcaster Rai: "The city is on its knees."</p>
